Glasswire is the ultimate data usage monitor for Android! Our app makes it easy to monitor your mobile data usage, data limits, and WiFi network activity. Instantly see what apps are slowing your phone’s Internet connection or wasting your mobile data.

### Key features

- glasswire’s data alerts keep you under your data limit and save you money on your monthly phone bill. Get alerted before you reach your carrier data limit to avoid overage fees.
- See a graph of which apps are currently using your mobile carrier data or Wi-Fi Internet connection.
- Instantly know every time a new app accesses the network and begins using Wi-Fi or mobile data.
- Swipe right to go back in time to see which apps used mobile data earlier in the week or month. See past Wi-Fi or mobile usage by day or month.
- Go to glasswire's "Data Plan" screen to set up zero-rated apps that won't have their data usage counted against your data plan. glasswire can also keep track of roaming, and roll-over minutes. Create a data usage widget.
- Check glasswire’s Speed Meter on its notification bar to quickly see real-time data usage. Help protect your privacy and reveal suspicious app activity through glasswire’s graph.
- Block apps from connecting to the network, or allow or deny new connections before they start with glasswire’s mobile firewall. Create multiple firewall profiles, one for mobile and one for WiFi.
